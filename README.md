First Project Git
New to 2020 Coding world, but more familiar with the previous term:  Programming.  First program writting was in BASIC on a Tandy Color Computer 3.  That was some time ago, but it was a competitor to the Apple IIc .  Had some formal instruction in Computer Math Classes, then self taught some HTML and well, hear and now.
